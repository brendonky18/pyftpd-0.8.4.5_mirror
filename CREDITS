Special thanks go to Peter Cagarda for selfless tedious testing on
Windows, and to Pavol Domin for not being afraid to install and use
first pre-alpha version, and to Tomas Stanys and Radoslav Bohm for
letting me try pyftpd on their computers, and most importantly to Marco
Amrein for his pyFTPdrop, on which is pyftpd based.
